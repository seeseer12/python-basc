a=30
b=50
# print(not False)

# print(not True) 


# print(not b)
# print(not a==20+120)


# summary: b is 20, which is truthy (because it's a non-zero number).

# not b means "not truthy," so it evaluates to False.

# Hence, print(not b) outputs False.








# and/or
print("and operator and or") 
print(a and b)
# both true so return last op







print(a or b)
# if one is false, return first false
# if 1 true reutn 1st true
# eg:
c=0
d=37
print(c and d)  # Output: "" (empty string is falsy)
